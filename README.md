# Frosts - An incredibly convenient pandas-inspired data science framework in Excel Office Scripts

![Frost Logo](docs/images/frosts_logo.svg)

An OfficeScript-native basic data science library designed to streamline Power Automate Excel automation, and increase the ease of use for aggregating, merging, and describing datasets entirely in Excel.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

Implementing frosts in your office scripts is incredibly easy! Either:

- Download `frosts.osts`, and move into your Office Scripts directory (likely: `"~/OneDrive/Documents/Office Scripts"' or similar)
- Copy and paste the contents of `frosts.ts` into an empty Office Scripts file

>*Unfortunately the current Office Scripts engine does not support imports, so a frost_template file will have to be copied for each project until this feature gets added*

## üìñ Documentation

To learn more about the specifics of frosts syntax and performance see the [Complete Namespace Guide](https://joeyrussoniello.github.io/frosts/)

## üßä Permafrost Compiler (Optional Frosts Minimizer)

In most cases, a deployed script won‚Äôt use every method in the `frosts` namespace ‚Äî and all that extra code and documentation can unnecessarily bloat the file. This is especially important when deploying production scripts via Automate, where compactness and clarity matter.

**Permafrost** is a lightweight executable tool that strips away all unused `fr.`/`DataFrame` methods and internal JSDoc comments from your final `.osts` script. It‚Äôs useful when you want to:

- **Minimize file size** for easier pasting into Excel's Office Scripts editor  
- **Avoid clutter** by only including the methods your script actually uses  
- **Copy and share** condensed, production-ready versions of Frosts scripts

### üì• Download

1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/JoeyRussoniello/frosts/releases)
2. Download the correct archive for your system:

   | OS      | File                                                              |
   |---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Windows | `permafrost-1.0.0-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.zip`                      |
   | macOS   | `permafrost-1.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`                    |

3. Extract the file if necessary (e.g., right-click ‚Üí ‚ÄúExtract All‚Äù on Windows)

> Note: Linux Architecture is not yet supported, but is planned for a future update
---

### Run the Tool

1. **Double-click the executable** (e.g., `permafrost.exe` on Windows)
2. You‚Äôll see:

   ```bash
   ‚ùÑÔ∏è Welcome to Permafrost!
   What frosts file would you like to condense?
   (We'll search in Documents, Downloads, and this directory)
   ```

3. **Type the name of your `.osts` file** (e.g. `frosts.osts`). *Note: File Name Inputs are handled case-sensitively and require the .osts file extension by design*
4. The cleaned script will be:
   - ‚úÖ Truncated to only the used methods
   - ‚úÖ Copied to your clipboard for easy pasting into Office Scripts

The `permafrost` compiler is still in Beta, so if you fact **any accuracy issues** please submit an issue with the content of your main function (NO FR NAMESPACE). We'll work on patching any compiler bugs as quickly as possible.
