# Frosts - An incredibly convenient pandas-inspired data science framework in Excel Office Scripts

![Frost Logo](docs/images/frosts_logo.svg)

An OfficeScript-native basic data science library designed to streamline Power Automate Excel automation, and increase the ease of use for aggregating, merging, and describing datasets entirely in Excel.

## ⚙️ Installation Instructions

Implementing frosts in your office scripts is incredibly easy! Either:

- Download `frosts.osts`, and move into your Office Scripts directory (likely: `"~/OneDrive/Documents/Office Scripts"' or similar)
- Copy and paste the contents of `frosts.ts` into an empty Office Scripts file

>*Unfortunately the current Office Scripts engine does not support imports, so a frost_template file will have to be copied for each project until this feature gets added*

## 📖 Documentation

To learn more about the specifics of frosts syntax and performance see the [Complete Namespace Guide](https://joeyrussoniello.github.io/frosts/)
