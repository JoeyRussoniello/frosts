**Frosts** is a lightweight, Pandas-inspired data automation framework built for [Office Scripts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/overview/excel) in Excel. It helps you clean, reshape, analyze, and export data ‚Äî all inside Excel Online or Power Automate ‚Äî using code that's easy to read and powerful to run.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è What is Frosts?

Think of Frosts as **pandas for spreadsheets** ‚Äî designed specifically for Excel scripting, with:

- A familiar, readable API (`df.filter()`, `df.groupBy()`, `df.pivot()`, etc.)
- Excel-aware features (formula columns, worksheet-to-JSON export, etc.)
- No external tools, libraries, or installs required

> ‚ú® It brings the **power of scripting** to **people who already know Excel**, and it keeps the syntax simple enough for first-timers.
