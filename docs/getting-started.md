# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions
Implementing frosts in your office scripts is incredibly easy! Either:
- Download `frosts.osts`, and move into your Office Scripts directory (likely: `"~/OneDrive/Documents/Office Scripts"' or similar)
- Copy and paste the contents of `frosts.ts` into an empty Office Scripts file

*Unfortunately the current Office Scripts engine does not support imports, so a frost_template file will have to be copied for each project until this feature gets added*
# üßÆ frosts.DataFrame

A lightweight `DataFrame` class inspired by pandas, designed for tabular data manipulation, exploration, and transformation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Create a `DataFrame` by using a frost helper function
```ts
const selectedSheeet = workbook.getActiveWorksheet();
// Create a df from the entire used range in selectedSheet
let df_from_sheet = frosts.df_from_sheet(selectedSheet);

//Create a df from a specified range;
let df_from_range = frosts.df_from_range(selectedSheet.getRange("A1:D100"));
```

Or by passing in a 2D array where the **first row is the header**:

```ts
const data = [
  ["Name", "Age", "Score"],
  ["Alice", 25, 88],
  ["Bob", 30, 92],
  ["Charlie", 28, 79],
];

const df = new frosts.DataFrame(data);
```
